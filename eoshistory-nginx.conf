#
# Example Nginx config file for `privex/EOSHistory`
#
# To use this file:
#  - copy it into /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/eoshistory.conf
#  - replace "/home/lg/EOSHistory" with the actual path you've installed EOSHistory at
#  - adjust the port in the "upstream eoshistory" if you've changed it from the default,
#  - adjust the server_name from eoshistory.example.com to your own (sub)domain if you have one
#
# Once adjusted for your specific installation, run the following:
#
#    systemctl enable nginx
#    systemctl restart nginx
#
# Assuming you've pointed a domain at your server, and gunicorn is running, then you should be able to go to
# http://eoshistory.example.com/api/   (replace with your domain), and view the EOSHistory API.
