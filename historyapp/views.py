    A transaction is a part of a [block](/api/blocks) which contains zero or more **actions** - the actions

    Included with each transaction result is a list of hyperlinked ``actions``, which allows you to
    easily query for the related actions to each transaction.
    
    You can go directly to individual transactions via their TXID, e.g.
    [/api/transactions/b3c40bdb774ec03ee4f2b27728dc1d579c646b15e7d144a7ec1c33b90229e08d/](

    """
    An action is a part of a transaction, and contains useful information such as who sent it, and what it's
    actually doing.
    
    Included with each ``action`` result, is a backlink to the ``transaction`` it's part of, as well as
    a ``block_url`` which is a hyperlink back to the block it's part of.

    Unlike transactions and blocks, actions don't have a consistent ID on the network. Generally the *correct*
    way to reference an action is via it's transaction ID and index (position in the transaction's list of actions).
    
    For example, to reference the 2nd action in the transaction
    ``c4f4215e419fd3886ff5fb3486a963e667fd8fb8194a9343c09f42e679f609be`` you'd query it as below:
    
    ``
    /api/actions/?transaction__txid=c4f4215e419fd3886ff5fb3486a963e667fd8fb8194a9343c09f42e679f609be&action_index=1
    ``
    
    To ease querying ``transfer`` actions, we've included some additional fields which are a reference to the
    ``data`` JSON object: ``tx_from``, ``tx_to``, ``tx_memo``, ``tx_amount``, ``tx_precision``, ``tx_symbol``
    
    You can also filter transactions by various fields, see the "Filters" button in the top right.

    Most fields can be queried just by entering their name as a GET query, for example:
    [/api/transactions/?tx_from=privexinceos](/api/transactions/?tx_from=privexinceos)
